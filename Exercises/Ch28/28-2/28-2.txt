Continuous deployment means that software releases are continuously released through automated deployments, for example after every sprint. This is not suitable for all kinds of software, but is regularly used for web-based software. After every sprint when new features have been added or bugs have been fixed, the new release of the software is automatically deployed by the build infrastructure. The old, currently running version of the software is ‘retired’, which means it’s only allowed to finish handling all requests that are currently already in flight. All new requests are directed to the new version of the software. Once the old version is finished with handling all old requests, it can be brought offline. All this happens automatically.
