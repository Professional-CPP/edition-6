It's clear that a car is not an engine, or a tire, or a driving light.

So, the car and its components should be modeled with has-a relationships. A car has an engine, it has (usually) four tires, it has driving lights, it has windshield wipers, and so on.

For the game, there will be an Engine class modelling the engine and keeping track of its current power output and its fuel usage. A Tire class models a single tire and keeps track of its pressure. A DrivingLight class models a single driving light, and a WindshieldWiper class models a single windshield wiper. Finally, the Car class then contains one instance of Engine, four instances of Tire, two instances of DrivingLight, and two instances of WindshieldWiper.
